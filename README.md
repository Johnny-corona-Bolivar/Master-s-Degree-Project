# Master's Degree-Project


## Objective


To assess the security of Android mobile applications by analyzing three APK files from different sources, aiming to identify common vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Mobile Top 10. The goal is to develop a critical understanding of mobile app risks by applying both static and dynamic analysis, using practical tools that strengthen real-world mobile security practices. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of security.

### Skills Learned


- Static analysis of APK files, including inspection of source code, configuration files, and declared permissions.
- Dynamic analysis of app behavior, using emulators and monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity, network connections, and resource usage.
- Identification of mobile vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Mobile Top 10, such as insecure data storage, improper cryptography, or data exposure.
- Comparative risk evaluation based on APK source (unofficial, unverified repository, and official store), building critical thinking for mobile security assessment.


### Tools Used

- Android Studio – Integrated development environment (IDE) for building, running, and debugging Android applications.
- Apktool – Tool for reverse engineering Android APKs to decode resources and analyze app structure.
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) – Command-line tool to communicate with Android devices for debugging and app interaction.
- VirusTotal / ShenmeApp – Online analysis platforms for scanning APKs and detecting malware or suspicious behavior.
- Jadx – Decompiler that converts Android APKs into readable Java source code for static analysis.
- MobSF (Docker) – All-in-one automated mobile security framework for static and dynamic analysis of Android/iOS apps.
