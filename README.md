# üîç Project 3‚Äì Reverse Engineering 

This repository contains the analysis and reconstruction of an x86 assembly function as part of a reverse engineering final project.

## üìÑ Project Description

The objective of this project is to reverse engineer a compiled program by analyzing the `main` function in x86 assembly, identifying its structure and logic, reconstructing it in C code, and modifying its behavior.

### üîß Original Assembly Function

The project starts with a dumped version of the `main` function in x86 assembly, which performs operations on a hardcoded string and generates a numeric code based on its content.

Key elements:
- Stack alignment and preservation of registers
- Retrieval of a static string (`"3jd9cjfk98hnd"`)
- Calculation using each character of the string and its position
- Output of a result using `printf`

---

## ‚úÖ Objectives

1. **Divide the assembly into basic blocks**  
   Identify segments of code with single entry and exit points, considering jump conditions and control flow.

2. **Create the control flow diagram**  
   Diagram showing how the basic blocks connect, representing conditional and sequential execution.

3. **Identify control structures**  
   Recognize if the function uses loops or conditionals and specify which blocks are involved.

4. **Translate assembly to C code**  
   Convert the entire `main` function to readable and functional C code.

5. **Compile and execute**  
   Compile the C version using:
   ```bash
   gcc source.c -o source -m32
   
## üìö Skills Developed
- Assembly Language Analysis: Understanding and interpreting x86 assembly instructions and function structure.
- Basic Blocks & Control Flow: Identifying basic blocks and constructing control flow diagrams from low-level code.
- Reverse Engineering: Translating assembly code into high-level C code by analyzing program logic and behavior.
- C Programming: Writing and modifying C code based on reverse engineered logic.
- Compilation & Execution: Using GCC with 32-bit flags (-m32) to compile and run C programs.
- Debugging & Testing: Validating the correctness of the translated code through compilation and runtime testing.
-Problem Solving: Applying logical reasoning to infer high-level constructs from low-level assembly.
- Software Engineering Best Practices: Documenting reverse engineering processes clearly and professionally.

# üõ°Ô∏è  Ethical Hacking

## üìú Project Description

This project is the capstone exercise for the Ethical Hacking module. It is divided into two main parts

### Part 1 ‚Äì Targeted Reconnaissance and Scanning  
Given only the name of an organization (freely chosen), the task is to gather as much publicly available information as possible through open-source intelligence (OSINT) and active scanning techniques.

Focus phases include:
- **Reconnaissance (Passive & Active)**  
- **Fingerprinting**
- **Scanning (Ports & Services)**

The goal is to identify:
- Employee information
- Domains and subdomains
- Public IP addresses and servers
- Exposed services or technologies

All findings must be documented along with the tools used and the corresponding phase of the ethical hacking process.
